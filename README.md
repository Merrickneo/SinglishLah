#  SinglishLah!

# Description
SinglishLah! is an IOS mobile application aimed at helping non-locals get accustomed to the Singlish culture here in Singapore. This application provides real-time translation from Singlish to English and at the same time reinforces learning through quizzes.

# Languages and API used:
Languages: Swift, Python, Firebase, ReactJS 
API: Google Cloud Translate API, Python Speech Recognition API

# Features:
We seek to create a mobile application that can help tourists and other “non-native” speakers of Singlish be able to have an enjoyable and hassle-free stay in Singapore. With the help of SinglishLah!, they can have access to real-time translation of Singlish.

The app should be able to interpret speech and be able to translate them in real-time. It should also be able to give users information about certain words and phrases by searching them up on the app.

To reinforce learning for our users, we can incorporate several quizzes to quiz their knowledge on Singlish and Singapore in general. This is likened to several language learning games or apps. EXP accumulated by the user can be used to exchange tourist attraction vouchers that can be used to offset ticket prices at various tourist attractions in Singapore.

Overall, we envision the app to be an everything-in-one application that meets the needs of our non-native Singlish speakers to assimilate into the Singlish speaking culture here in Singapore.
